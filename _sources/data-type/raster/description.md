A coverage on a regular grid of cells, each cell carrying one value per band; how many bands it has, and what they mean, is its range type.

## Definition

`https://geolabs.github.io/bblocks-data-types/def/data-type/raster` is a `dt:DataType` in the `dt:dataTypes` concept system. It names a kind of data, not its encoding.

## Hierarchy

- Broader: none (top-level data type)
- Narrower: [Raster (multiple bands)](../raster-multi-band/), [Raster (single band)](../raster-single-band/)

## Content of this block

- `ontology.ttl`: the concept, its governed `dt:DataTypeVersion`, the proposed addition action and the register item that realizes the version (canonical source).
- `schema.yaml`: a profile of the vocabulary's data type item schema (itself a profile of the RIM register item), with `id` fixed to this item.
- `examples.yaml`: the register item in JSON, validated against the schema, uplifted to RDF and checked against the shapes, and the same graph in Turtle.
